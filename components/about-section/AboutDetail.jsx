          Returning to Australia I moved into technology commercialisation where
          I marketed and sold early-stage technologies developed at the
          Institute of Molecular Bioscience. I was fortunate to work with
          amazingly smart, passionate people, including some potential future
          noble lauareates, who all believed in making the world a better place.
          I also ran business bootcamps for PhDs, trying to get them to come to
          the dark side of commercialisation.
          <br />
          <br />
          From there I moved to Sydney to run the industry business development
          team at the University of Sydney, where we handled any engagement with
          industry across all technology sectors. I got exposed to an enormous
          range of technology there, but I was desperate to find a more dynamic
          experience and so jumped at the chance to join an early stage startup
          Oomph as a junior sales exec (any seat on the rocketship). &nbsp;I
          ended up running the sales and customer service teams as VP Commercial
          and launched the business into the US and generally had a blast doing
          it.

          Next up was a late-stage, very well-funded (Series E, 900M) adtech
          player MediaMath where I ran the Asia business from Singapore as VP
          Commercial. &nbsp;Averaging five countries a month, I launched both
          South Korean and India which have both gone on to become powerhouse
          markets.

          We returned to Australia in 2019, just in time for Covid, before
          building my first ever product using nocode tools for Mobius, an
          automated patient tracking platform that I co-founded. Mobius is
          venture-backed with multiple enterprise clients.

          What I really love is working with other early-stage founders and
          companies to help build and scale there sales machines. I’m active in
          multiple startup and adjacent communities and would love to work with
          you. If you are an early-stage founder/company and you are looking to
          build/refine/accelerate your B2B sales then let’s talk.
