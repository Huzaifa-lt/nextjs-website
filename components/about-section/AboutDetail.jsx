          Technology intrigued me from before I started understanding the value
          that it can bring to the table. While other boys were enjoying cricket
          or arcade gaming ( which I also excelled at ), I was looking into code
          from a neighbour who wrote the frog-crossing game in Basic. We are in
          early 90s here! Among other inspiration was another neighbour who was
          trying out the Wolfram AI chat system, and I was blown over by outstanding
          conversation between a "chatbot" and a user. Suffice to say that the AI
          systems have been a stepping stone in developing what and how I have
          accomplished so far. Surprising how we are still in the midst of another
          renaissance with AI. Great thing is that I have years of experience in
          connection with top consulting and big-data analytics including solid
          expertise in ML/AI and related systems' design and implementation.

          While topping the MATHs. education system for multiple years until I
          got to study in another city since I was 18 years of age. That was the
          time where I excelled at C++ and building multiple chess engines and 
          mostly backend applications. LUMS ( one of the top universities in Asia )
          opened my eyes on the amazing talent of PhD students and highly educated
          teaching body from the likes of MIT, Harvard and Oxford. Again, apart
          from some social sciences courses that I despised, I was acing my CS
          courses with flying colours. This was even while mostly hanging around
          with friends for life. CS ( Computer Science ) provided me with the 
          challenge that paved for an adventurous life that followed.

          Next up was another life-changing event in reaching Sydney, Australia as
          a Master's level student at University of New South Wales ( recognized 
          highly in World's university ranking ). Long story short, I ended up as
          a software engineer at Visionbytes ( owners wanted to launch a product 
          within the company that would have brought a Youtube-like system for at-
          least the Australian market ). After the GFC in 2008 though, I diverted
          my attention to yet another round of running my own "cloud" company. You
          could search the archives of Australian company register and will find my
          company as the first IT company providing cloud consulting company before
          that name became a household attention.

          Finally I "started" my career in the world of Search Engine Marketing with
          a Silicon Valley based company called Marin Software. The exposure and the
          value that it brought me was some of the highest I had seen to date. With
          day-in-day-out consulting with the clients, I realized how immensely valuable
          and far reaching were / are the consequences of reaching the right audience
          at the right time. Then finally at MediaMath ( Series E, 900M valued ), I 
          became a true champion of building custom / bespoke solutions dealing with 
          immense amounts of data with the veracity of big-data at a Programmatic AdTech
          company. The exposure overall with building cloud-native solutions especially
          with AWS and GCP has truly developed my skills. I enjoy applying them to 
          Start-Ups and Scale-Ups businesses taking them from a local small business to
          one that could tackle the likes of mid-to-enterprise companies concentrating
          on their niche products and services.
