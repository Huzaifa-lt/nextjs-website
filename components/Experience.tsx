            With more than a decade at VC-backed startups + scale ups I’ve
            launched and sold new products and services across Australia, APAC
            and the US. I’ve built and run teams through direct, JVs or
            partnership models.&nbsp;I’m most passionate about early-stage,
            high-growth startups. <br />
            <br />
            As a Fractional VP Sales I can help with anything from go-to-market
            strategy, getting hands-on building outreach campaigns, or team
            development, to pipeline reviews, sales strategy, and beyond.
